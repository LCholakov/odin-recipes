    <h3>Extremely fast way to fry bread with eggs right inside the pan</h3>
    <p>This is a simple recipe that I make every morning. Super fast and produced the absolute minimum amount of dirty dishes.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients (feeds 1)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>3-4 slices of bread</li>
        <li>a pinch of salt</li>
        <li>oil for frying (my dad uses sunflower seed oil)</li>
        <li>some honey</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat some oil in a frying pan over medium fire.</li>
        <li>Just before the oil gets hot crack the eggs inside.</li>
        <li>Very quickly take a slice of bread and using circular movements break one of the yolks, lightly mixing the eggwhite and yolk and coating one side of the bread. Flip it over and lay the slice with the coated side up.</li>
        <li>Repeat for the other slices, arranging them to fit the pan. Sprinkle a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Turn up the heat, wait a bit and flip the whole thing. I flip it like a pancake, it can also be done with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Give a minute or so and flip over a big plate. Adjust time according to preference. I like the egg soaked in the bread a bit juicier so I take them out farely fast.</li>
        <li>Drizzle a spoonful of honey over the eggy slices. You can add cheeses and anything you like to the side. </li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
