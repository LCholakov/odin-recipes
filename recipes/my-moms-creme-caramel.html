    <h3>This tasty crème caramel is a good idea any time of the day</h3>
    <p>My made this when I was a kid and I loved it. As I grew up and moved to live far away, the only way to taste my mom's cooking was to cook it myself. This is her recipe.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients (feeds 4)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>6 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 vanilla sugar packet</li>
        <li>1L milk</li>
        <li>12-14 tbsp sugar for caramel</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the eggs, add the cup of sugar and mix again until the sugar is somewhat dissolved.</li>
        <li>Add the vanilla sugar and milk. Mix thouroughly. Do not use a blender or anything that rotates fast to avoid air bubbles in the mix.</li>
        <li>Pour the sugar for caramel in a small pot and put it over medium-low fire.Mix the sugar and increase the heat gradually untill all the sugar is melted and changes color to light brown. A little bit of water can be added to the sugar to make the caramel more creamy.</li>
        <li>Start preheating the oven to 180&deg;.</li>
        <li>Using a spoon pour one or two spoonfuls of caramel in a crème caramel bowl. Quickly rotate the bowl to coat the whole bottom. Repeat for all the bowls.</li>
        <li>Pour the crème caramel mix in the bowls. Arrange them in a baking tray.</li>
        <li>Add water to the baking tray, about one or two fingers deep. This is extremely important so that the goods come out evenly cooked, with a smooth texture inside.</li>
        <li>Put the baking tray with bowls and water bath inside the preheated oven on a lower shelf. Bake for about 30 minutes. Add time if the bowls are big, reduce the time if the bowls are smallish.</li>
        <li>Keep an eye on the crème caramel, it can and will change color but should not burn on the top. You can occasionally add ice cubes to the water bath to prevent it from boiling.</li>
        <li>When ready, after approximately 30 min of baing, take the tray out. Let the whole thing cool off in room temperature. After that cool the bowls down overnight in a fridge.</li>
        <li>To serve: with a small spoon nudge the edge of the crème caramel around the whole bowl. Place a small saucer upside-down on top of the bowl and flip in a single swift motion. Shake down if necessary. If all goes well, you should have a beautiful crème caramel on a saucer with the caramel side up. If there is hardened caramel left on the bottom of the bowl you can leave the bowls sit in the fridge for another day or so and the caramel will melt.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
