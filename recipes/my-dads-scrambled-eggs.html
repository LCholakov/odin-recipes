    <h3>Scrambled eggs with white cheese and paprika powder</h3>
    <p>This is a simple recipe that my dad used to make when I was a kid. He still makes it sometimes when I visit my hometown.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients (feeds 2)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>6-8 eggs</li>
        <li>250-300g sirene cheese</li>
        <li>1 tbsp paprika powder</li>
        <li>a pinch of salt</li>
        <li>oil for frying (my dad uses sunflower seed oil)</li>
        <li>some parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat some oil in a skillet over medium-high fire.</li>
        <li>When the oil is hot crack the eggs inside and turn the heat up a bit.</li>
        <li>Crush the cheese with your fingers and add it over the eggs.</li>
        <li>Mix the eggs and cheese and sprinkle the paprika powder over them.</li>
        <li>Stir a bit more until all the eggs are cooked but don't overdo it because the eggs will come out dry. The eggs should be a bit moist but not jelly-ish.</li>
        <li>Serve on your favourite plates and decorate with parsley.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
